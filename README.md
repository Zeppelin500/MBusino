# MBusino
[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.9.21-brightgreen.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)<br/>
### M-Bus --> MQTT-Gateway with shields for ESPs

A **Plug and Play** solution.

M-Bus decoding uses the project's own library [**MBusinoLib**](https://github.com/Zeppelin500/MBusinoLib). Test the library [**via Wokwi.**](https://wokwi.com/projects/402235052803622913)
The serial data link layer communication is handled by [**MBusCom**](https://github.com/Zeppelin500/MBusCom).

Mbusino has a captive and setup portal to configure WiFi, MQTT, M-Bus, and Sensors.

## Code

the project is developed with **Arduino IDE 2**, source code and .bin files will be find at the **src** folder.  

**MBusino** code is for a single M-Bus Slave

**MBusino5S** code is for up to 5 Slaves

## Hardware

### MBusino

The original MBusino decodes M-Bus and can also optional read out different sensors, see below. Network connection only via the build in ESP32 WiFi.
- M-Bus e.g. heatmeter (up to three slaves, use the 3S code)
- OneWire 5x DS18B20, temperature
- IÂ²C BME280, temperatur, r. humidity, air pressure

The MBusino is usable for "only M-Bus" or "only sensor measuring" as well. Beside the USB power supply of The ESP is no other adapter necessary.

Use 2,54mm terminals or JST XH to connect the DS18B20

You will find a 3D-printable PCB case inside the case folder. The edition Z need a different case, usable for both versions. 
The PCB is designed with fritzing.

M-Bus is provided by a piggyback M-Bus master.
There are two MBusino versions available for two different M-Bus masters.

The "old" version for a chinese M-Bus Master.

Supported ESP-Boards: ESP8266 D1 mini, or D1 mini Pro(4M) with extern antenna for better Wifi range and the ESP32 S2 mini

The new "**edition Z**" version for a german M-Bus master from Zihatec. Many thanks to HWHardsoft for making the board available especially for us.

Work only with the ESP S2 mini.

### MBusino Nano

A pure M-Bus --> MQTT gateway without extra sensor measuring but with Wifi **and** Ethernet connectivity.
ESP32 C3 Supermini with W5500 Lite Ethernet Modul and Zihatec M-Bus Modul.

To save money, I place omnibus orders for all parts beside the M-Bus Master.

## Access Point to configure,  MBusino Setup Portal

* SSID **MBusino Setup Portal** IP(normally not needed): 192.168.4.1
* If Mbusino do not find a known network, he start an AP for 5 minutes. After this period, he will restart and search again.
* In known networks, you will find the IP of the portal under **MBusino** in your router.

## MQTT Output

## Home-Assistant

If you use Home Assistant, MBusino supports autodiscover. You need only the MQTT integration and MBusino will be find as device with all records.
Every 256th record message is a autodiscover message. 
If you use not Home Assistant, no matter. All records will be send as MQTT message.


## M-Bus Polling (optional)

Normaly M-Bus request is set with an interval at the GUI. But in special cases you can set the interval to a long period to save slave battery life and poll the M-Bus records by a MQTT request as often as you want between. E.g. M-Bus Interval 2.592.000 sec. (30 days) and poll high frequently between in interesting phases.

### MBusino
* MQTT Topic: MBusino/mbusPolling
* MQTT Payload: no matter

### MBusino3S
* MQTT Topic: MBusino/mbusPolling
* MQTT Payload: M-Bus Address in decimal (you can also request addresses witch are not stored in the GUI)

## calibration capabilities 

Most DS18B20 are faked and out of specifications.
You can calibrate the sensors by sending a MQTT message to MBusino.
Subscribe at topic MBusino/cal/# for calibration replies. 

### 1. Set the average of all DS sensors
* MQTT Topic: MBusino/calibrateAverage
* MQTT Payload: no matter

Make the average of the connected sensors and add an offset to every sensor. After the calibration, all sensors will show the same value.
You have to bring all connected sensors to the same environment, wait a little bit and send the calibration message.

### 2. Calibrate to a connected Bosch BME280 Sensor
* MQTT Topic: MBusino/calibrateBME
* MQTT Payload: no matter

Make an offset for every DS sensor based at the meassured value of the BME sensor. After the calibration, all sensors will show the same value.
You have to bring all connected sensors to the same environment, wait a little bit and send the calibration message.

### 3. Calibration by hand
* MQTT Topic: MBusino/calibrateSensor
* MQTT Payload: Number of the Sensor to calibrate (only the number). e.g.S3 = 3
* MQTT Topic: MBusino/calibrateValue
* MQTT Payload: a float number e.g. -0.15

Manipulate the offset of a single sensor by sending sensor numbers and values. The transmitted value will be added to the current offset. First chose the sensor, then send the value. If a sensor is chosed, multiple manipulations of the same sensor are possible.


### 4. Set all offsets to zero
* MQTT Topic: MBusino/calibrateSet0
* MQTT Payload: no matter

Self explanatory.

## known issues / limitations
- Flashing over USB is only possible, if the M-Bus master is not connected. OTA update work fine.

- Do not use 2 Boards simultaneously without changing thr Name or it cause in network problems, both boards becomes unreachable. 

- M-Bus should work with most M-Bus devices. If you have M-Bus issues, let me know.

- No support of multi telegram messages. Only the first telegram will be decoded
